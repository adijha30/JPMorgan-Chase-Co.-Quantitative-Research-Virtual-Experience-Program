# Task 1
This task involved making predictions about fuel prices across seasons <br/>

The prices follow a seasonal hike every winter, and then have a drop when the warm weather comes back. This is accompanied by the steady increase in price of the fuel as the years go by. Below is a picture which nicely represents the trend

<br/>

My code to predict the prices a year into the future is a simple linear regression performed for each day of the next year using data from 3 or 4 years depending on availability
